    1. Ur goal is to WIN
    2. If u move to {end_state} - you WIN 
    3. If ur opponent has no valid moves - they LOSE
    4. U CANNOT move to *** in {path}
    5. U can only move to DIRECTLY CONNECTED *** in {available_moves}

    DECISION PRIORITIES

    1 - WIN:
    - Check if {end_state} is in {available_moves}. If YES: MOVE TO

    2 - BLOCK OPPONENT'S WIN:
    - If u cannot win immediately, analyze possible moves
    - For each candidate *** (connected to {cur_state} and not in {path}):
      * If {end_state} is in ***'s neighbors → AVOID
    - Choose a SAFE *** if available, else: random ***
    
    3 - CHECK FUTURE 
    - if you go to ***, player goes to $$$ from *** and u have NO MOVES from $$$ - AVOID ***
